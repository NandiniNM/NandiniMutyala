This site is hosted using Github. I created this as a part of my assignment for my P8105: Data Science assignment course. The source code can be found in the public repository: NandiniMutyala.github.io, which can be accessed by clicking the github logo at the top of the page. I hope you were able to learn a little bit about me and thanks for stopping by!
